	abstract = {We present a suite of experiments with a hierarchy of biogeochemical models of increasing complexity coupled to an offline global ocean circulation model based on the " transport matrix method" Biogeochemical model structures range from simple nutrient models to more complex nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus-DOP models. The models' skill is assessed by various misfit functions with respect to observed phosphate and oxygen distributions. While there is generally good agreement between the different metrics employed, an exception is a cost function based on the relative model-data misfit. We show that alterations in parameters and/or structure of the models - especially those that change particle export or remineralization profile - affect subsurface and mesopelagic phosphate and oxygen, particularly in the upwelling regions. Visual inspection of simulated biogeochemical tracer distributions as well as the evaluation of different cost functions suggest that increasing complexity of untuned, unoptimized models, simulated with parameters commonly used in large-scale model studies does not necessarily improve performance. Instead, variations in individual model parameters may be of equal, if not greater, importance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We have extended the 3-D ocean based "Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model" (GENIE-1) to help understand the role of ocean biogeochemistry and marine sediments in the long-term (\${\textbackslash}sim\$100 to 100 000 year) regulation of atmospheric CO2, and the importance of feedbacks between CO2 and climate. Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007). We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yrâˆ’1, and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3:POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr-1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates. The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest ({\textgreater}1 000 000 year) time-scales.},
